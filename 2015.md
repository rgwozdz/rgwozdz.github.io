#Products & Company Initiatives

## Static API document generator


**Overview:** [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) plugin (via NPM) for generating Markdown or simple HTML documents that detail API endpoints described by Swagger-spec JSON.  This differs from other API doc generators in that the docs need not be served by a web-server with the aid of client-side model/view frameworks.  The markdown docs generated by this plugin can be easily viewed as part of a GitHub repo.

**Role:**   Creator, developer  
**Tech stack:** Node.js, Grunt.js  
**Code repository:** [https://github.com/spatialdev/static-api-docs](https://github.com/spatialdev/static-api-docs)

## Ansible IT Automation
**Overview:** Company seeks to automate the building of its development and deployment environments with an established IT automation framework.  After research, I successful used the Ansible framework for provisioning Amazon EC2 with a typical backend tech stack for our applicaitons: PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Node.js, PM2, and Nginx.  
**Role:** Research and prototyping

## Inherited Object-level Permissions with PostgreSQL
**Overview:** Company seeks to implement user permissions on a per object basis. Objects may be related hierarchically, and thus user permissions on a given object should be inherited from its ancestor unless specifically assigned. The querying of these permissions needs to be performant despite potential for millions of user-object permutations.  
**Role:** Research and prototyping  
**Tech stack:** PostgreSQL
